## Writing documentation

Read [docs/authoring.md](docs/authoring.md) before writing or editing any docs page — it is
the complete reference: voice, file layout, the validated-example annotation format
(`check=`/`output=`/`skip=`), the frozen corpus examples are authored from, and the
capture/validation workflow. Every `curl`/`lantern` example must be validated; unannotated
command blocks fail the build.

## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and
`astro dev logs`.
